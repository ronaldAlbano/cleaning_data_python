**Situation**

Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is [around 10%]. This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed [around £1.5 billion], which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!

I have been asked to work with a bank to clean the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward so would like you to ensure it conforms to the specific structure and data types that they specify so that they can then use the cleaned data you provide to set up a PostgreSQL database, which will store this campaign's data and allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported. 




**Task**

They have supplied me with a csv file called `"bank_marketing.csv"`, which I will need to clean, reformat, and split the data, saving three final csv files. Specifically, the three files should have the names and contents as outlined below:

**Results**
Successfully cleaned and reformatted the data from bank_marketing.csv.
Split the data into three well-structured CSV files (client.csv, campaign.csv, economics.csv) with appropriate columns and data types.
Facilitated the setup of a PostgreSQL database for the bank, enabling easy import of cleaned data from future marketing campaigns. This helps the bank maintain consistent and reliable data for their marketing analytics.
